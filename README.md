## Overview

A look into each and every task I attempted to solve, with my own code. I separated each solution into a different folder for convinience.

### Links

- [Github repository with my solutions](https://github.com/Jirobow/git-mdn-web-docs-tasks)

### Built with

- VS Code (enhanced with Prettier and Path Intellisense extensions)
- Nodejs (v18.17.1) + live-server node app.

### What I learned

Recaped HTML fundamentals and CSS's basics, mostly gaining confidence.

### Continued development

My main goal here is to have all of this be second nature moving forward, gaining familiarity with not only HTML, but CSS and even git too, focusing on my future carrer as a fullstack dev.

I'm not comfortable with designing from scratch (an empty styles.css file, for example) yet, but by repeating these and other tasks/challenges this could and will be accomplished.

### Useful resources

- [Git Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/8JJ101D3knE) - Gave me a solid understanding and much more confidence with Git.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Provided an easy-to-understand step-by-step path to learning front-end dev, plus this README template.
- [W3schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) - Easy to pick-up tutorial with most of the commonly used properties, plus exercises. Concise and full of interactivity, this was a life-saver.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com) - Nothing like a little game to practice, and this one teaches display:flex in CSS like any other.
